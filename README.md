# DisMELS
DisMELS is a framework for developing/running individual-based models(IBMs) for marine species with pelagic early life stages, such as flatfish species like northern rock sole (Lepidopsetta polyxystra) and arowtooth flounder (Atheresthes stomias) or invertebrate species like southern Tanner crab (Chionoecetes bairdi) or market squid (Todarodes pacificus). The framework is written in java and the graphical user interface is built on Netbeans IDE components.
